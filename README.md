This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Creating a Shop-App
Creating a shop similar to the polymer-shop-app, but with React. Using it's details/pictures/layout, but coding it on my own.

## Todo
- Add notification popup when adding thing to cart
- Actual styling outside of bootstrap layout
- ~~Back button to work~~
- ~~# of items in cart should should actually quantity of items, not just how many rows there are~~
-- I actually think it's fine this way after viewing some more stuff.
- If you add an item of same size/type, it should be added to quantity, not another row itself.
- ~~Need to calculate total~~
- Add a fake checkout thing
